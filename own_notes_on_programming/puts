The puts() function is used to write specified string plus a new line to the standard ouput stream.The ending null character is not written.
Upon successful completion, puts() shall return a non-negative number.
Otherwise, it shall return EOF, shall set an error indicator for the stream, and errno shall be set to indicate the error.

Syntax:
int puts(const char *str)

Difference from printf()
The puts() function prints a newline after the text supplied.
The puts() function prints the string as it is (% codes are not processed)
